Friends Project

Using an array implementation of a graph, I coded multiple methods:
- Find the Shortest Path between any two "People" using a BFS approach
- Seperate and Return Graphs of a given type, in this case Students in the same School
- Find all Connectors (Nodes of the graph without which any person could not reach another person)
